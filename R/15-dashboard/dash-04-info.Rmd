### Regions

The regions were derived using *only* daily snow depth series from 1981 to 2010 for the months December to April. No information on location or elevation was used. No post-processing of the assignment of the series to regions was performed, so some series in certain locations might be assigned to a region which does not make total sense. The most likely reason for this *mis-assignment* is that the series have a unique climate and snow variability, which cannot be found in the series of the neighbouring region. With more series available, this situation might change.

For assigning the series to regions, a multivariate technique was used, which extracts the major sources of variability in the data (principal components analysis). This was followed by an automatic clustering technique (k-means), using 2 to 5 regions.


### Trend analysis

The trends were calculated using linear regression for the period 1971 to 2019. Besides mean monthly snow depth, multiple snow indices were calculated based on the daily snow depth series: mean seasonal snow depth, maximum seasonal snow depth, and snow cover duration (days with snow depth > 1cm). The means and indices were calculated if >90% of the daily observations in the month/season were available. The trends were only computed if the series had data available for all years. For the overview, only the estimated linear trend in cm per decade is shown (or days per decade).
